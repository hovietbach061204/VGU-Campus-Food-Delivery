# VGU-Campus-Food-Delivery
Our goal is simple: to make food delivery on campus more convenient, more affordable, and more community-driven. Instead of relying on expensive third-party apps, students who are already out at eateries can help bring food to those who need it, creating a peer-to-peer network of food delivery that benefits everyone
